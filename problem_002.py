Solution for Project Euler problem 002
https://projecteuler.net/about

Problem 002 asks for the sum of all even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million. Two solutions are given:

The fist solution computes all terms of the Fibonacci sequence and verify if they are even or odd.

The second solution uses a property of the Fibonacci sequence: there is always two odd terms between two consecutibe even numbers.
