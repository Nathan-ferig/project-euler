# My solutions for Project Euler problems

> "Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler") provides challenging mathematical problems for learning and enjoyment. At the present time, Project Euler lists almost 750 problems. 

My intend with this repository is to showcase my **problem solving skills** by solving some of those problems. In order to make it even more challenging, I will avoid to use common Python libraries — such as numpy — and code my solutions from scratch. 

The project rules allows sharing solutions just for the first one-hundred problems. In accordance with this, I will not share any solution for the 100+ problems.  

Comments and suggestions are welcome,

Thank you,
